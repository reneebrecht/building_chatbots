The 1950s ushered in a slew of UFO sightings and excitement about outer space. Incidentally, the decade also brought about a new idea of artificial intelligence. The computer scientist Alan Turing proposed that if a computer was able to fool a human into believing it was human, the computer would be considered “intelligent.”

While your bot may not pass a true Turing test, perhaps it could pass an “E.T.uring” test if you can successfully fool a human into believing that your chatbot is, in fact, an alien.
